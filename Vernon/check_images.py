# PURPOSE: Check images & report results: read them in, predict their
#          content (classifier), compare prediction to actual value labels
#          and output results
#
# Use argparse Expected Call with <> indicating expected user input:

#             --dogfile <file that contains dognames>
#   Example call:
#    python check_images_solution.py --dir pet_images/ --arch vgg --dogfile dognames.txt
